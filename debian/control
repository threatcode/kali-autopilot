Description: Kali Autopilot
 Kali Autopilot is a tool to help develop automatic attack scripts 
 for red and purple teaming.
 .
 It is primarily intended to create scripts that attack vulnerable
 machines in the Kali Purple platform for detection and response
 training but it is also useful for creating scripts used for
 penetration testing.
